# An acrylic stacked case for Sofle V1/V1.1
**Material**: Laser-cut 3mm acrylic sheets 

- When using **3mm acrylic sheets**, ensure you get **M2 spacers**with lengths that match the number of layers in your case. For example, this case uses 4 layers, where 2 layers are mid ones.
  Choose M2 spacers that are approximately 6mm in length.
  
- However, to ensure safety and a proper fit—since most 3mm acrylic sheets are actually around 2.7–2.8mm—it's recommended to use 5mm spacers instead.

- You can also edit the number of mid layers or use 4mm or 5mm acrylic sheets instead. However, ensure that you get proper fitting spacers accordingly.  
  It's recommended to not go above M2.5 screws, as larger holes may weaken the mid layers and cause them to break, given that acrylic is not very strong.

### Suggested Bill of Materials  
- **M2 Spacers (5-6mm)**:  
  - Each side needs 6 spacers (12 in total).  
  - Optional: Add 10 more (5-6mm 5 each side) spacers for extra stability.  
- **M2 Screws (4-5mm)**:  
  - At least 50 screws for assembly + 10 screws for OLEDs.  
- **M2 Spacers (10-15mm)**:  
  - 2 spacers per side (4 in total).  
  - Length depends on how the MCU is socketed; shorter lengths may suffice.
